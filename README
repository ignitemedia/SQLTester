.NET application tests connectivity to a Microsoft SQL server. 
It provides the ability to test connectivity only, or to perform a 
read query in addition to a connectivity test. Tests can also be looped.  
The application logs data to normal.log and error.log located in 
the same directory as from which the app is executed. If errors occur, 
the app logs to error.log. Otherwise data is logged to normal.log. 

To begin testing execute the SQLTester and in the shell type 'test'. 
You will asked to provide several parameters such as host,
DB name, credentials and the query. The query can be any SQL statement
(so use the utility cautiously). If the statement is a select, the 
utility will write the results of the first column only into the log. 
All other columns are ignored sine this is meant to simply verify we can get data.
